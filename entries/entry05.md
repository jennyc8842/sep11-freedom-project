My freedom project is finally finished after working really hard on it for several months. Once again, it is called Produrela. Produ stands for productive and rela stands for relax. It is a great website to help users study, relax, and be productive. On the website, there will be a list of music the user can listen to and a timer. This is made by using EarSketch, the tool I choose to make music using Javascript.
