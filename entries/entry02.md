## Sources

I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpaU2UtBSGE">quick research</a> to see if the tool I chose, EarSketch was the right one for my time management program. From my research, I found that
EarSketch is mainly used to make music, which I was looking for and it looks pretty straightforward on what you have to do to make music.

I also found <a href="http://emilyserven.net/ref-docs/js-lib-ref-earsketch.html">a handy website</a> that shows some of the code I can use to make music that you want. 
There were also multiple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3k8qQ2UMlg">short, quick YouTube tutorials</a> on the basics on how to code on EarSketch that I've watched to learn as well.


## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I'm currently at stage 3 and 4 of the Engineering Design Process: <b>brainstorming possible solutions</b> and <b>planning the most promising solution</b> on how to make my time management program more unique than compared to other
programs related to my idea. 

To do this, I have to start <b> brainstorming possible solutions</b> by looking for time managing programs on what <i>they have and what they don't have.</i> I've noticed that for most of known, popular ones them have do have a timer for each specific category you want to complete, such as <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/apps-tools/best-time-management-apps/#Clockify">Clockify</a>.
There is also another program called <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/apps-tools/best-time-management-apps/#RescueTime">RescueTime</a> which measures the time you spend on different websites a bit too long and it will alert you. However, what I don't see a lot is that most of them don't include music in their programs; they don't 
have a feature where you can listen to music while the timer goes on.

So, the <b>most promising solution</b> is to make a program that allows the user to choose the music to listen to from a list, or let the program randomly shuffle the list
of music for the user to listen to, while the timer is on for however long they want it to be. 

For the next stage of the Engineering Design Process, I plan to be on stage 5, <b>creating a prototype</b> similar to the idea above on EarSketch and then uploading the music I made on a repl and Github. I would start to code on my repl and Github to make a timer and allow the user to choose the music they want to listen to from a list
and have an option for users to shuffle the music list.

## Knowledge

The <b>tool</b> I have decided on is <b><a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/">EarSketch</a></b>. It is a free, educational, programming website where users
can compose music and remix them to their liking by using two popular languages, Python and Javascript. 

I've decided to make a project based on <b>time management</b>. This project is unique because it will have a list of music that users can choose from to
listen to, or have the option to shuffle the listed music. There will be a timer that users can use to keep track of how much time is spent on whatever they want or have to do. Listening to music can help them study, relax, and get things done. Using EarSketch will make this program easier because EarSketch is mainly focused on making music and I can use it to make a list of music that the users can choose from. 

Lately, I've been tinkering by using the main website of EarSketch and watching tons of YouTube videos on how to start coding using Javascript on EarSketch.
Using what I've learned, I started to code something myself.


<br>
Here are some code snippets:
<br>
<br>
```fitMedia(HOUSE_ACOUSTIC_PIANO_005, 1, 1, 10);```
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>fitMedia</b></tt>: add sounds to the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)</li>
<li><b><tt>HOUSE_ACOUSTIC_PIANO_005</b></tt>: the name of the audio clip from EarSketch</li>
<li><b><tt>1, 1, 10</b></tt>: what track to the audio clip on, the measures do you want it to start, the measures which you want it to end
</ul>


<br>
<br>
```setTempo(120)```
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>setTempo</b></tt>: sets the tempo on how fast or slow you want the audio to be</li>
<li><b><tt>(120)</b></tt>: since its a large number, the tempo will go a bit fast</li>
</ul>


## Skills

The skills that I used are <b>creativity</b> and <b>consideration</b>.

I used the skill, <b>creativity</b> when I had to find ways to make my program different and unique from other programs similar to mine. I had to think of ways that could make 
users come and check out my program and to do that, I have to think outside the box by asking myself if I were a user, what would interest me to try this new program, or what are 
some ways to make this program easily accessible, So, I started to check out multiple programs similar to my ideas and see what made them successful, or easy to use. 
For example, I could add in a dark mode feature for users to those who like the background dark, or I could add something that organizes the list of music I made from EarSketch for it to be easily assessed. This would prevent the hassle of checking every music to see what 
the genre they are in.

I used the skill, <b>consideration</b> when I had to think how this program would benefit <i>not only myself but others as well,</i> so it is important that
I consider the impact that I can create for others from what I am making. Using this skill, I was able to come up with the idea of a program that helps with managing your time better because it is a main problem for most people daily.
