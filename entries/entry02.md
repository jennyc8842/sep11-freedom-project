## Sources

I did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpaU2UtBSGE">quick research</a> to see if the tool I chose, EarSketch was the right one. From the video, I found that
EarSketch is mainly used to make music, which I was looking for and it looks pretty straightforward on what you have to do to make music. I also found
<a href="http://emilyserven.net/ref-docs/js-lib-ref-earsketch.html">a handy website</a> that shows some of the things I can code to make the music that you want.


## EDP
I'm currently at stage 3 and 4 of the Engineering Design Process: <b>brainstorming possible solutions</b> and <b>planning the most promising solution</b> on how to make my time management program more unique than compared to other
programs related to mines. To do this, I have to look for time managing programs on what they have and what they don't have. I've noticed that most of known, popular ones them have do have a timers for each specific category you want to complete, such as <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/apps-tools/best-time-management-apps/#Clockify">Clockify</a>.
There is also another program called <a href="https://clockify.me/blog/apps-tools/best-time-management-apps/#RescueTime">RescueTime</a> which measures the time 
you spend on different websites a bit too long and it will alert you. However, what I don't see a lot is that most of them don't include music in their programs; they don't 
have a feature where you can listen to music while the timer goes on.



So, the <b>most promising solution</b> is to might make a program that allows the user to choose the music to listen to from a list, or let the program randomly shuffle the list
of music for the user to listen to, while the timer is on for however long they want it to be. For the next stage of the Engineering Design Process,
I plan to be on stage 5, <b>creating a prototype</b> similar to that idea.

## Knowledge

The <b>tool</b> I have decided on is <b>EarSketch</b> and I plan to make a project based on time management using music as the background music with an added timer as well.
Lately, I've been tinkering by starting to code on EarSketch using what I have learned on mainly from YouTube tutorials.

<br>
Here are some code snippets:
<br>
<tt><b>fitMedia(HOUSE_ACOUSTIC_PIANO_005, 1, 1, 10);</tt></b>

<ul>
<li><b>fitMedia</b>: add sounds to the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)</li>
<li><b>(HOUSE_ACOUSTIC_PIANO_005)</b>: the name of the audio clip from EarSketch</li>
<li><b>1, 1, 10</b>: what track to the audio clip on, the measures do you want it to start, the measures which you want it to end
</ul>

And another one:
<br>
<tt><b>setTempo(120)</tt></b>

<ul>
<li><b>setTempo</b>: sets the tempo on how fast or slow you want the audio to be</li>
<li><b>(120)</b>: since its a large number, the tempo will go a bit fast</li>
</ul>


## Skills

The skills that I used are <b>creativity</b> and <b>consideration</b>.

I used <b>creativity</b> when I had to find ways to make my program different and unique than other programs similar to mine. I had to think of ways that could make 
users come and check out my program, and to do that- I have to think outside the box by asking myself if I were a user, what would interest me to try this new program. So, I started to check out
multiple programs similar to my ideas and see what made them successful, or easy to use. For example, I could add in a dark mode feature for users to those who like the background
dark, or I could add something that organizes the list of music I made from EarSketch for it to be easily assessed. This would prevent the hassle of checking every music to see what 
genre they are in.


I used the skill, <b>consideration</b> for me to think on how to this program would benefit <i>not only myself, but others as well,</i> so it is important that
I consider the impact that I can create for others from what I am making. Using this skill, I was able to come up with the idea of a program that helps with managing your time better 
because it is a main problem for most people on a daily basis.
