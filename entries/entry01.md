# Entry 1: Deciding what to make & what tool to use
##### 11/16/2020

## Sources
I've explored many tools by searching them up on Google, and at first I wanted to make a planner using the tool <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script">Google Apps Script</a>, or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> but everyone else in my class seem to be doing the same thing. 
I wanted to make something different, so I explored the tool <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/">Earsketch</a> and liked the idea of making music. 
I have also found a super detailed website about <a href="https://earsketch.gatech.edu/itec2120/book.html#:~:text=EarSketch%20is%20a%20DAW%20(Digital,to%20create%20music%20using%20Python.&text=Instead%20of%20providing%20a%20GUI,Python%20code%20to%20create%20music.">Earsketch</a> which was very helpful.


## EDP
I'm currently at stages 1 and 2 of the Engineering Design Process: <b>defining and researching the problem.</b> The <b>problem</b> which I see for most students like me 
is that they have <b>a difficult time managing their time</b>.
So, I need to make a time managing app with music using EarSketch. 
<br>
<br>
I started <b>researching the problem</b> and found multiple soures and videos on EarSketch, found in 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCfvzIWUikE">this YouTube video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIxwRrARmdo">another one</a> as well.
For the next stage of the Engineering Design Process, I plan to brainstorm possible solutions to show why you should use my app, and what makes it unique than other time managing apps.

## Knowledge
One tool I decided on is <b>EarSketch.</b> I'm planning to make a list of music using EarSketch for users to choose to listen to while studying, relaxing, etc. There will also be a timer for them if they'd like to use it for studying, baking, or just anything.

## Skills 
Two skills I have developed so far are <b>problem decomposition and how to google</b>. The <b>problem decomposition</b> is that when I first started researching about the different tools I want to use, I had to break it down into smaller pieces- starting with what I wanted to make, and then after when I decided what to make, I researched for a tool that are suitable for it while making my program.
<br>
<br>
I've also used skills like <b>how to google</b>. I needed to search up for good tutorials on how to code on EarSketch, and I searched up "EarSketch tutorial" and made sure to add in "Javascript" in my search bar. 
There were a few that were too long, but I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCfvzIWUikE">YouTube video</a> that was simple and short. It was very desciptive and I understood it pretty well.
