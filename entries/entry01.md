## EDP
I'm currently at stages 1 and 2 of the Engineering Design Process: <b>defining and researching the problem.</b> For the next stage of the Engineering Design Process, I plan to brainstorm possible solutions.

## Knowledge
One tool I decided on is EarSketch. I'm planning to make a list of music using EarSketch for users to choose to listen to while studying, relaxing, etc. There will also be a timer for them if they'd like to use it for studying, baking, or just anything.

## Skills 
Two skills I have developed so far are <b>problem decomposition and how to google</b>. When I first started researching about the different tools I want to use, I had to break it down into smaller pieces- starting with what I wanted to make, and then after when I decided what to make, I researched for a tool that are suitable for it while making my program. I've also used skills like how to google to know the details about my tool and what I'm working with.
